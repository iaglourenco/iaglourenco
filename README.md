### I'm Iago — Software Engineer

> Building smart systems, writing meaningful code, and constantly learning along the way.

I'm a developer with a passion for **Artificial Intelligence**, creative problem-solving, and writing clean, thoughtful software. I love exploring how machines can learn, evolve, and interact with the world — and I’m always looking for better, faster, and more elegant ways to make that happen.

From low-level optimization to high-level ideas, I believe in crafting code that’s not only functional, but expressive. I’m especially drawn to projects that combine **intelligence, interactivity**, and **a bit of chaos** — the fun kind.
